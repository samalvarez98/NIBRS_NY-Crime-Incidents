Results

Of the 101 agencies that sent their crime data, Monroe County presented the highest number of crime incidents in 2020 with more than 9000 incidents, September the month with the highest number of crime incidents.  Brooke County in the southeast and Oneida County in the MId east were 2nd and 3rd respectively with the highest number of crime incidents in 2020. Similarly to Monroe County, Brooke, and Oneida had  August or September as their months with the highest number of incidents. This observation might give policymakers a better view of when crime tends to go up and which are the counties with the highest crime incidents issues. Interestingly, it was observed that the crime trend went down similarly in the three counties after August or September. However, when taking all fifteen counties together, the forecast indicated the number of crime incidents had to increase in 2022. From this analysis, it is clear that crime incidents went from low levels at the beginning of the year to high levels in the 3rd quarter of the year.

The second dashboard, it was analyzed the top five offenses with the highest number of incidents when a weapon was used during the incident. (See the dictionary to understand the definitions of the weapons used). Additionally, it was observed that the offense was committed by a male or a female. After analyzing the data, the analysis indicated that simple assault was the most common offense when a weapon was used during the incident, with 6341 simple assaults using especially personal weapons to commit the crimes. Aggravated assault was the second most common type of offense when a weapon was used, with 894 offenses registered. However, this time knife/ cutting instruments were the most common weapon used which makes sense with the definition established for the type of offense and the type of weapon. This analysis will help policymakers determine what weapons are being used the most to commit criminal offenses.
